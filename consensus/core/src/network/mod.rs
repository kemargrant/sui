//! This module defines the network interface, and provides network implementations for the
//! consensus protocol.
//!
//! Having an abstract network interface allows
//! - simplying the semantics of sending data and serving requests over the network
//! - hiding implementation specific types and semantics from the consensus protocol
//! - allowing easy swapping of network implementations, for better performance or testing
//!
//! When modifying the client and server interfaces, the principle is to keep the interfaces
//! low level, close to underlying implementations in semantics. For example, the client interface
//! exposes sending messages to a specific peer, instead of broadcasting to all peers. Subscribing
//! to a stream of blocks gets back the stream via response, instead of delivering the stream
//! directly to the server. This keeps the logic agnostics to the underlying network outside of
//! this module, so they can be reused easily across network implementations.
